Reeepeated characters
Back to your sentiment analysis! Your next task is to replace elongated words that appear in the tweets. We define an elongated word as a word that contains a repeating character twice or more times. e.g. "Awesoooome".

Replacing those words is very important since a classifier will treat them as a different term from the source words lowering their frequency.

To find them, you will use capturing groups and reference them back using numbers. E.g \4.

If you want to find a match for Awesoooome. You first need to capture Awes. Then, match o and reference the same character back, and then, me.

The list sentiment_analysis, containing the text of three tweets, and the re module are loaded in your session. You can use print() to view the data in the IPython Shell.
