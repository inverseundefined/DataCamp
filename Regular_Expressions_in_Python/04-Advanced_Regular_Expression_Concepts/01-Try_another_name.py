Try another name
You are still working on your Twitter sentiment analysis. You analyze now some things that caught your attention. You noticed that there are email addresses inserted in some tweets. Now, you are curious to find out which is the most common name.

You want to extract the first part of the email. E.g. if you have the email marysmith90@gmail.com, you are only interested in marysmith90.
You need to match the entire expression. So you make sure to extract only names present in emails. Also, you are only interested in names containing upper (e.g. A,B, Z) or lowercase letters (e.g. a, d, z) and numbers.

The list sentiment_analysis containing the text of three tweets as well as the re module were loaded in your session. You can use print() to view it in the IPython Shell.
