Everything clean
Back to your Twitter sentiment analysis project! There are several types of strings that increase your sentiment analysis complexity. But these strings do not provide any useful sentiment. Among them, we can have links and user mentions.

In order to clean the tweets, you want to extract some examples first. You know that most of the times links start with http and do not contain any whitespace, e.g. https://www.datacamp.com. User mentions start with @ and can have letters and numbers only, e.g. @johnsmith3.

You write down some helpful quantifiers to help you: * zero o more times, + once or more, ? zero or once.

The list sentiment_analysis containing the text of three tweet are already loaded in your session. You can use print() to view the data in the IPython Shell.
