On time
Lastly, you want to rewrite an old real state prediction project. At the time, you obtained historical information about house prices and used it to make a prediction on future values.

The date was in the datetime format: datetime.datetime(1990, 3, 17) but to print it out, you format it as 3-17-1990. You also remember that you defined a dictionary for each neighborhood. Now, you believe that you can handle both type of data better with f-strings.

Two dictionaries, east and west, both with the keys date and price, have already been loaded. You can use print() to view them in the IPython Shell.
