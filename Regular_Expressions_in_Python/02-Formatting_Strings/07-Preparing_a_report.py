Preparing a report
Once again, you scraped Wikipedia pages. This time, you searched for the description of useful tools used for text mining. Your first task is to prepare a report about different tools you found. You want to format the information contained in the dataset to be printed out as: The (tool) is a (description).

In this case, template strings are the best solution to interpolate data generated by external sources into an already created template.

For this example, the variables tool1, tool2 and tool3 contain three article titles. Each variable description1, description2 and description3 contains the corresponding article description.

If you want to explore the variables, you can use print() to view them in the IPython Shell.

First of all, import Template from string module.
Complete the template using $tool and $description identifiers.
Substitute identifiers with the correct tool and description variables in the template and print out the results.

# Import Template
from string import Template

# Create a template
wikipedia = Template("$tool is a $description")

# Substitute variables in template
print(wikipedia.substitute(tool=tool1, description=description1))
print(wikipedia.substitute(tool=tool2, description=description2))
print(wikipedia.substitute(tool=tool3, description=description3))
