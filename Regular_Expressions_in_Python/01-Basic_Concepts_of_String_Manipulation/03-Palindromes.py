Palindromes
Next, you are committed to find any peculiarity in the words included in the movie review dataset. A palindrome is a sequence of characters which can be read the same backward as forward, for example: Madam or No lemon, no melon. You realize that there are some funny movie names that can have this characteristic. You want to make a list of all movie titles that are funny palindromes but you will start by analyzing one example.

In python, you can also specify steps by using a third index. If you don't specify the first or second index and the third one is negative, it will return the characters jumping and backwards.

The text of a movie review for one example has been already saved in the variable movie. You can use print(movie) to view the variable in the IPython Shell.
