Add conditionals
The while loop that corrects the offset is a good start, but what if offset is negative? You can try to run the following code where offset is initialized to -6:

# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)
but your session will be disconnected. The while loop will never stop running, because offset will be further decreased on every run. offset != 0 will never become False and the while loop continues forever.

Fix things by putting an if-else statement inside the while loop. If your code is still taking too long to run, you probably made a mistake!

Instructions
100 XP
Inside the while loop, replace offset = offset - 1 by an if-else statement:
If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
Else, you should increase offset by 1.
